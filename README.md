### Introduction

"My Mechanic" The title of this project.My name is Tusher Ahmed and this project is developed for my third year course. Ok, The main motivation for making this project to make customer and mechanic life easier. I will explain it to you through a story.
Suppose you are going somewhere with your car and middle of the way your car faceing some technical issue, the place is unknown to you and there is no one nearby to ask for help. In this situation what will you do??
ok you can wait for someone to ask for help or you go to find garage for repair your car, but this is a lengthy process and the success rate to find garage in time is impossible.
To solve this problem, I build this site . Where the customer can easily find garages around him through the google map and can visit the mechanic store , can choose his expected survices and hire them through the website.The mechanic also registered as a mechanic in this website ,after registered as a mechanic all the users can see his shop in the map and can visit directly from map to his store and can hire him.
I think the customer and the mechanic both of them are benefitted by the website and it can make their life more easier.
