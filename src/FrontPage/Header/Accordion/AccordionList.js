    details:
      "If a mechanic sends you a bid and they say 'Diagnosis Needed'  this means they will come out and figure out what is wrong with your vehicle plus offer you 1 hour of auto repair services. This way if it’s an easy fix you’ll be covered if it can be completed within 1 hr.

A diagnosis also gets subtracted from your total bill on repair jobs greater than one hour. If you choose to hire the mechanic for the full repair.",
